- It is important that you always start a separate branch when developing or when you are working on a new feature. **Never** change any code in the main branch.
- The format of the branch creation should always be *username_nameOfFuncion*.
- Never merge branches without a pull request and a review.
- After a successfull merge, treat yourself with a pat on your shoulder and a warm beverage.
